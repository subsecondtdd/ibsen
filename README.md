# Ibsen

Ibsen is a small framework that decouples tests from the system under test (SUT).
Tests using Ibsen interact with the application via *actors*, *interactions* 
and *sessions*.

Why would you want to decouple your tests from the SUT? Three reasons:

- Tests can run in milliseconds
- Tests become more maintainable
- Tests become more readable
